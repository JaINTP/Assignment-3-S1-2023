# HomewareCity Shopping Cart System

This repository contains the code for a Python-based shopping cart system, developed as part of my self-directed work on university-level assignments. The program was designed according to the specifications provided by the [CSC1401 - Foundation Programming Assignment 3](https://www.coursehero.com/file/204036200/CSC1401-Assignment-3-Specificationpdf/).

## Overview

The system manages a simple shopping cart, allowing users to:

- Add shopping records (with product codes, quantities, and shipping methods).
- Display all records with detailed information.
- Calculate the total cost of items, including delivery fees and high-value surcharges.
- Search for specific products within the shopping cart.

## Features

- **Input validation**: Ensures that product codes and quantities are within acceptable ranges.
- **Cost calculation**: Applies additional fees for delivery and high-value items.
- **Search functionality**: Case-insensitive keyword search across product names.
- **Formatted output**: Displays records and their details in a structured table.

## How to Use

Run the script and follow the menu options to:

1. Add records to the shopping cart.
2. Search for specific items.
3. Calculate the total cost of items in the cart.

## Assignment Specification

The program was developed based on the [assignment outline](https://www.coursehero.com/file/204036200/CSC1401-Assignment-3-Specificationpdf/) provided by the University of Southern Queensland, found on Course Hero.
